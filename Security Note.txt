Flow of Authentication Process:

1. User submits login credentials (username and password).

2. The AuthenticationManager is invoked by Spring Security to handle the authentication.

3. The AuthenticationManager checks which AuthenticationProvider should handle the authentication.

4. DaoAuthenticationProvider is selected because it’s configured to use database-backed authentication.

5. DaoAuthenticationProvider calls the UserDetailsService to fetch the user details from the database.

6. The DaoAuthenticationProvider compares the provided password with the stored password (using a PasswordEncoder).

7. If the passwords match, DaoAuthenticationProvider returns a fully authenticated Authentication object, which is passed back to the AuthenticationManager.

8. The user is considered authenticated and granted access based on their roles and permissions.
